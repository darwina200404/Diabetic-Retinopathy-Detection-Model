# 🎯 Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Using Deep Learning
This project aims to detect Diabetic Retinopathy, a diabetes complication that affects eyes, using deep learning techniques. It leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify retinal images into various stages of the disease, helping in early diagnosis and reducing the risk of vision loss.

## 📂 Features
✅ Image preprocessing and augmentation for improved model performance

✅ CNN-based architecture trained on retinal fundus images

✅ Multi-class classification (No DR, Mild, Moderate, Severe, Proliferative DR)

✅ Visualization of training metrics and model predictions

✅ Can be extended to real-time detection with appropriate API or UI integration
